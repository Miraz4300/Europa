By 2030, The SDGs resolutions is to eliminate hunger, improve food security and nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Malnutrition's triple burden – undernutrition, hidden hunger, and obesity – threatens children's and young people's survival, growth, and development. Children who are well fed have a higher chance of growing and learning, participating in their communities, and being robust in the face of disease, and other calamities. To eliminate the problem these are the main resolution for this project:
1. Reduce Food  Waste;
2. Solve malnutrition problems for children;
3. Solve the hunger problem;
4. Protect the environment from food waste pollution;
5. Lower middle-class people can buy foods at a discounted price.


Food owners(restaurant/hotel/From house) can sell the extra food for a particular amount of money at the end of the day, they will make a profit. Land used to produce wasted food and the cost of natural resources will be significantly reduced. With the help of Corporate social responsibility (CSR) companies can come together & get beneficial from financial & non-financial way.100% of donations will go to fund collection. Donations will work as meals for ‘n’ children for ‘n’ days. Schools that wish to receive donations can  Register to Receive Donations.This donation will help to end the malnutrition problems of school children.


Our objective is to support the zero food waste movement by recognizing businesses and individuals who care for our planet, as 45% of food produced in Bangladesh is wasted.
