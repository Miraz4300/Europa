By 2030, The SDGs resolutions is to eliminate hunger, improve food security and nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Malnutrition's triple burden – undernutrition, hidden hunger, and obesity – threatens children's and young people's survival, growth, and development. Children who are well fed have a higher chance of growing and learning, participating in their communities, and being robust in the face of disease, and other calamities. To eliminate the problem these are the main resolution for this project:
1. Reduce Food  Waste;
2. Solve malnutrition problems for children;
3. Solve the hunger problem;
4. Protect the environment from food waste pollution;
5. Lower middle-class people can buy foods at a discounted price.
